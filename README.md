## Installation

#### Important!
**Always back up your code tree and database before applying an import package or code tree patch!**

### Pre-requisites

1. Aras Innovator installed
2. Aras Manufacturing Process Planning (MPP) installed
3. Aras Package Import Utility
4. aras.labs.mbom_export package

### Install Steps

1. Backup your database and store the BAK file in a safe place.
2. Open up the Aras Package Import tool.
3. Enter your login credentials and click **Login**
    * _Note: You must login as root for the package import to succeed!_
4. Enter the package name in the TargetRelease field.
    * Optional: Enter a description in the Description field.
5. Enter the path to your local `..\mbom-export\Import\imports.mf` file in the Manifest File field.
6. Select the following in the Available for Import field.
    * **aras.labs.mbom_export**
7. Select Type = **Merge** and Mode = **Thorough Mode**.
8. Click **Import** in the top left corner.
9. Close the Aras Package Import tool.

You are now ready to login to Aras and start exporting.

#### Optional: Use Report instead of an Action

By default, this project adds an Action to the mpp_ProcessPlan ItemType called Export MBOM. If your users would rather access this feature from the Reports menu instead of the Actions menu, you can remove the Export MBOM Action from the mpp_ProcessPlan ItemType and instead attach the included labs_ExportMBOM Report.

1. Login to Innovator as admin.
2. Open the mpp_ProcessPlan ItemType for editing.
3. Remove the labs_ExportMBOM Action from the Actions tab. 
4. Add the labs_ExportMBOM Report to the Reports tab.
5. Save, unlock, and close the mpp_ProcessPlan ItemType.

The usage steps documented below still apply. Just access the Export MBOM feature from the Reports menu instead of the Actions menu where applicable.

## Usage

>Note: The steps below for both use cases start from the Process Plan item window, but the Export MBOM action can also be run from the main grid. You don't have to open the Process Plan or MBOM view to use the Export MBOM action.

### Export to PDF

1. From the Process Plan, select **Actions > Export MBOM** from the main menu.
2. In the Export Options dialog, select the Location and Produced Part you want to use to resolve the MBOM. 
    * These dialog fields are populated from the Locations and Produced Parts relationships on the Process Plan.
3. Select **PDF** from the Export Type dropdown list.
4. Click the **Export MBOM** button to begin the export.
5. In the new browser window that opens, enter **CRTL+P** or manually open the browser's print options.
6. Select **Microsoft Print to PDF** as the printer.
    * Note: You may need to enable the browser's background image/graphics settings in order to see the alternating table row colors.
7. Click Ok/Print.
8. When prompted by the file system, choose a location and file name for your exported PDF file.

    * These dialog fields are populated from the Locations and Produced Parts relationships on the Process Plan.
3. Select **Excel** from the Export Type dropdown list.
4. Click the **Export MBOM** button to begin the export.
5. In the browser prompt that appears, confirm whether you want to open or save the Excel file.
6. Open the file for viewing or editing as needed.

>Note: When you open the Excel file, you may receive a warning about the file type. This is a known issue but does not affect the usability of the file. As a workaround, run Save As on the file to avoid seeing the message next time you open workbook.
